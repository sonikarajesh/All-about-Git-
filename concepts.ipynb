        "# **Git**\n",
        "\n",
        "Git is a *distributed version control system* that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, keeping track of changes, managing different versions of files, and facilitating team coordination.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Key concepts of Git**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Repository (Repo):**\n",
        "   - A repository is a storage space where your project's history and files are kept.\n",
        "   - It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clone:**\n",
        "   - Copying a repository from a remote server to your local machine is called cloning.\n",
        "   - This creates a local copy of the entire project, allowing you to work on it without affecting the main repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Commit:**\n",
        "   - A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.\n",
        "   - Each commit has a unique identifier and includes changes made to files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Branch:**\n",
        "   - Branches are independent lines of development in a Git repository.\n",
        "   - They allow developers to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.\n",
        "   - The main branch is typically called \"master\" or \"main.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Merge:**\n",
        "   - Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch.\n",
        "   - This is often done to incorporate new features or bug fixes into the main branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Pull:**\n",
        "   - Pulling refers to fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into the current branch.\n",
        "   - It's often used to update your local repository with changes made by others.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Push:**\n",
        "   - Pushing involves sending your committed changes to a remote repository.\n",
        "   - This is how you share your work with others or update the remote repository with your local changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Fetch:**\n",
        "   - Fetching retrieves changes from a remote repository but does not automatically merge them into your working branch.\n",
        "   - It's useful for reviewing changes before deciding to merge or pull.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Remote:**\n",
        "   - A remote is a version of a repository that is hosted on the internet or another network.\n",
        "   - Common remote hosting services include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Pull Request (PR):**\n",
        "    - In a collaborative development environment, a pull request is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another.\n",
        "    - It allows team members to review and discuss the proposed changes before they are merged.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Conflict:**\n",
        "    - A conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches.\n",
        "    - Resolving conflicts involves manually editing the conflicting files to create a merged version.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **.gitignore:**\n",
        "    - The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.\n",
        "    - This is useful for excluding files like build artifacts or temporary files from being tracked by Git.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Basic Git Commands**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Configure Git:**\n",

        "##**Best industrial practices for using Git:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Opt for Small, Focused Commits**   \n",
        "   - Make commits that address specific changes or features for better comprehension.\n",
        "   - Avoid combining unrelated changes within a single commit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Craft Clear and Brief Commit Messages**\n",
        "   - Ensure commit messages are succinct and express the purpose of each change.\n",
        "   - Aim for commit messages under 10 words to enhance readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Frequent Branching for Isolating Changes**\n",
        "   - Create branches dedicated to distinct features or bug fixes to compartmentalize changes.\n",
        "   - Embrace branching to facilitate parallel development and minimize conflict risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Embrace Pull Requests for Code Reviews**\n",
        "   - Initiate code reviews through pull requests (PRs) to gather input before merging.\n",
        "   - PRs encourage collaboration, uphold code quality, and provide a controlled space for modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Cloning a repository to local system**\n",
